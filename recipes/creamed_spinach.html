    <p> Creamed spinach, made with the frozen chopped variety, perfectly complements the roast, and it can be made up to two days ahead. </p>
   <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li> 1 ½ cups whole milk 
   <li>4 (10 ounce) boxes boxes frozen chopped spinach, thawed and squeezed dry; reserve 1/2 cup liquid </li> 
   <li>3 large garlic cloves, minced</li>
   <li> 2 tablespoons butter  </li> 
   <li>3 tablespoons all-purpose flour</li> 
   <li>½ cup grated Parmesan cheese </li> 
   <li>½ teaspoon ground nutmeg </li> 
   <li>Salt and ground black pepper </li> 
    </ul>
<h2>Instructions</h2>
    <ol>

     

        <li>Combine milk, spinach liquid and garlic in a 1-quart microwave-safe measuring cup or small bowl covered with a saucer, and microwave (or heat slowly in a medium saucepan) until very hot and steamy. Let stand for 5 to 10 minutes to soften garlic.</li>
    
        
        <li>Meanwhile, fill a large pot with lightly salted water and bring to a rolling boil. Cook mafalda noodles at a boil until tender yet firm to the bite, about 8 minutes. Drain.
      </li>
        
        <li>Melt butter in a Dutch oven over medium-high heat. Whisk in flour. Add hot milk mixture all at once, then whisk until smooth. Stir in spinach; cook until sauce is thick and bubbly and spinach is tender but still green, about 5 minutes. Stir in cheese, nutmeg, and a generous sprinkling of salt and pepper. Serve hot.</li>
        
        <li>After adding spinach to sauce the mixture can be turned onto a large rimmed baking sheet to cool quickly, then transferred to a covered container and refrigerated up to 2 days. Warm slowly over low heat. Stir in cheese and season with nutmeg and a generous sprinkling of salt and pepper. Serve hot.</li>
